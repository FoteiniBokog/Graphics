Project 1
In this exercise we created a window in which we drew 2D shapes in a programming language OpenGL.

Project 2
In this exercise we created a window in which we drew 3D shapes, more specifically a pyramid in a programming language OpenGL.

Project 3
In this exercise we created a window in which we load wavefront .obj object files and practice textures and model movement. So, we simulated the solar system, with a Sun at the center and a planet revolving around the sun and itself. We also added the ability to launch a meteor that explodes upon impact with the sun.
